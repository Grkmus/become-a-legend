hello everyone, I have a question about Vue. I have two components in home view which are players and daily-events. When I click to daily-event component I can enter the daily-event view and in this daily-event view there is a countdown timer which emits an event when time is up. The problem is I want to listen this event from the home view. Is it possible to do that? or is it a ridiculous idea? :slightly_smiling_face: I googled and found a solution like "$eventBus" but it has worked only for components that stated in the same view. In the Vue Debugger I can see the event is emitting but listener doesn't work. I upload some photo to explain it more clearly :slightly_smiling_face:  By the way, I am using only Vue without Vuex. Thanks!
